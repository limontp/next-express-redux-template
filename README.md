# Custom Express Server example with redux

Most of the time the default Next.js server will be enough but there are times you'll want to run your own server to integrate into an existing application. Next.js provides [a custom server api](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server).

Because the Next.js server is a Node.js module you can combine it with any other part of the Node.js ecosystem. In this case we are using express.

## How to use
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/limontp/next-express-redux-template.git
cd next-express-redux-template
```

2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

3. Run dev server
```
npm run dev
```
